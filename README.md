An in-depth analysis of Los Angeles crime data from 2020 onwards, focusing on trends, patterns, and geographical distributions using Python for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.

# Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis (2020-Present)

## Project Description
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing incident-level crime data from the City of Los Angeles, covering incidents from 2020 to the present. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into crime occurrences across different dimensions such as time, location, and crime type. This analysis demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python.

## Problem Statement & Goals
The primary goals of this analysis are to:
* Identify the most common types of crimes reported in Los Angeles.
* Analyze crime trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly patterns).
* Investigate the geographical distribution of crimes to identify high-incidence areas.
* Explore relationships between crime incidents and other available attributes (e.g., victim age, sex, descent, premise description).
* Provide data-driven insights that could potentially inform community safety initiatives or resource allocation.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the "Los Angeles Crime Data from 2020" provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) via [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present).

**Important Data Notes:**
* The data is transcribed from original paper crime reports and may contain some inaccuracies.
* Some location fields with missing data are noted as `(0°, 0°)`. These will require careful handling during analysis.
* Address fields are provided only to the nearest hundred block to maintain privacy.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For basic plotting and visualization.
* **Seaborn:** For enhanced statistical data visualization.
* **(Potentially others as needed):** e.g., Plotly for interactive visualizations, SciPy for statistical tests.

## Key Findings & Insights (To be updated)
*(This section will be populated once the analysis is complete. It will summarize the main discoveries, trends, and significant observations from the data.)*
